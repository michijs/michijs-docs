## Getting Started

You can use [this template](https://github.com/michijs/michijs-template) or you can see on [Code Sandbox](https://githubbox.com/michijs/michijs-storybook-template/tree/master).
  
## Creating components

MichiJS custom elements are plain objects.

New components can be created using the `jsx/tsx` extension, such as `MyCounter.tsx`.

```tsx
import { createCustomElement, EventDispatcher } from "@michijs/michijs";
import { counterStyle } from "./counterStyle";

export const MyCounter = createCustomElement('my-counter', {
  reflectedAttributes: {
    count: 0
  },
  methods: {
    decrementCount() { this.count-- },
    incrementCount() { this.count++ },
  },
  events: {
    countChanged: new EventDispatcher<number>()
  },
  adoptedStyleSheets: [counterStyle],
  observe: {
    count() {
      this.countChanged(this.count)
    }
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <button onpointerup={this.decrementCount}>-</button>
        <span>{this.count}</span>
        <button onpointerup={this.incrementCount}>+</button>
      </>
    )
  }
})
```

Note: the `.tsx` extension is required, as this is the standard for TypeScript classes that use JSX.

To use this component, just use it like any other HTML element:

```tsx
import '../Counter';

<my-counter oncountchanged={(ev) => console.log(`New count value: ${ev.detail}`)} />
```

Or if you are using jsx
```tsx
import Counter from '../Counter';

<Counter oncountchanged={(ev) => console.log(`New count value: ${ev.detail}`)} />
```
<!-- 
## How this works? 
When you update an item, the library looks for your changes and only updates the attributes / children / etc that really changed.

### But... Wait, DOM elements shouldn't be unique?
  
In this case I am going to quote Eric Bidelman, a Google engineer on [this topic](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom):
*For example, when you use a new HTML id/class, there's no telling if it will conflict with an existing name used by the page.*
That is to say that while it is inside the Shadow DOM you should not worry about if your ID is repeated with one outside the Shadow DOM.

### Why not use keys like React?
Searching with IDs is so much faster than searching by queryselector. You can look at [this topic](https://measurethat.net/Embed?id=99697) and [this another](http://vanilla-js.com)

### But... What if I don't want to use Shadow DOM?
You can use our id generator to create unique IDs for each element in your component with a discernible key. 
```tsx
render() {
    return (
        <>
            <style id={this.idGen('style')}>{style}</style>
            <button id={this.idGen('decrement-count')} onpointerup={this.decrementCount}>-<button>
        </>
    );
}
```
The result will be like this:

```html
<style id="093dc6b7-315d-43c1-86ef-fcd49130ea32"></style>
<button id="c8d61264-45ee-42ce-9f74-1d76402d1f48">-</button>
``` -->

## Component structure
A component consists of the following properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th colspan="3">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>attributes</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows to define attributes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nonObservedAttributes</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows to define non observed attributes. This is useful for 
      <a href="#observable-objects">complex objects that cannot be observed</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>reflectedAttributes</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows to define <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#reflectattr">reflected attributes</a> and follows the Kebab case. A reflected attribute cannot be initialized with a true value
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>transactions</td>
      <td colspan="3">Transactions are functions that notify changes at the end of the transaction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>methods</td>
      <td colspan="3">Methods are functions that notify changes at the time of making the change.</td>

      <td>cssVariables</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows to define CSS variables. CSS variables changes does not trigger a rerender.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>computedStyleSheet</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows you to define a Constructable Stylesheet that depend on the state of the component. When there is no shadow root the style will be reflected in the style attribute.</td>

      <td colspan="3">Function that renders the component.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td colspan="3">Contains methods with a name of an attribute / reflected attribute / css variables / observable like. Those methods are executed when a change has been made to their corresponding property.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="16">lifecycle</td>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="10">Custom Element related</td>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>connected</td>
          <td>This method is called when a component is connected to the DOM.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>willMount</td>
          <td>This method is called right before a component mounts.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>didMount</td>
          <td>This method is called after the component has mounted.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>willUpdate</td>
          <td>This method is called before re-rendering occurs.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>didUnmount</td>
          <td>This method is called after a component is removed from the DOM.</td>
        </tr>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="5">Form-associated Custom Element related</td>
        <tr>
          <td>formAssociatedCallback</td>
          <td>Called when the browser associates the element with a form element, or disassociates the element from a form element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>formDisabledCallback</td>
          <td>Called after the disabled state of the element changes, either because the disabled attribute of this element was added or removed; 
      or because the disabled state changed on a fieldset that's an ancestor of this element. The disabled parameter represents the new disabled state of the element. The element may, for example, disable elements in its shadow DOM when it is disabled.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>formResetCallback</td>
          <td>Called after the form is reset. The element should reset itself to some kind of default state. For input elements, this usually involves setting the value property to match the value attribute set in markup (or in the case of a checkbox, setting the checked property to match the checked attribute.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>formStateRestoreCallback</td>
          <td>
          Called in one of two circumstances:
            <ul>
              <li>
              When the browser restores the state of the element (for example,after a navigation, or when the browser restarts). The mode argument is "restore" in this case.
              </li>
              <li>
              When the browser's input-assist features such as form autofilling sets a value. The mode argument is "autocomplete" in this case.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The type of the first argument depends on how the setFormValue() method was called. 
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>events</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows you to define an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events">event</a> to his parent and triggering it easily. It will be defined using Lower case. For example countChanged will be registered as countchanged.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>subscribeTo</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows you to subscribe to an <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/observable-like.d.ts">observable like</a> (like a store). When the store emit an event, the custom element will be re-rendered.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shadow</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows you to add a Shadow DOM. By default, it uses open mode on Autonomous Custom elements and does not use Shadow DOM on Customized built-in elements. Only <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-element-attachshadow">this elements</a> are allowed to use Shadow DOM.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>formAssociated</td>
      <td colspan="3">This tells the browser to treat the element like a <a href="https://web.dev/more-capable-form-controls/">form control</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fakeRoot</td>
      <td colspan="3">Allows to create a fake root on the element. This is especially useful if you don't have shadow root. Since it allows you to add children from a parent node.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3">extends</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Allows to create a <a href ="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#extendhtml">Customized built-in element</a></td>

        <td>class</td>
        <td colspan="3">The class you want to extend</td>
      </tr>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If the extends field is not provided an [Autonomous custom element](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#shadowdom) will be created.

## store structure
A store consists of the following properties:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>state</td>
      <td>Allows to define the store state.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>transactions</td>
      <td>Transactions are functions that notify changes at the end of the transaction.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

stores use proxies to listen for changes in their state, in addition, they are observable.
Each component has an store to listen for changes in its state.


## CSS
To use css we provide functions to create Constructable Stylesheets.
### createStyleSheet
Allows to create a Constructable Stylesheet with a CSSObject
```js
export const counterStyle = createStyleSheet({
  ':host': {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row'
  },
  span: {
    minWidth: '60px',
    textAlign: 'center'
  }
});
```
### css
Allows to create a Constructable Stylesheet with a Template String.
[Recomended extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulmolluzzo.convert-css-in-js).

```js
export const counterStyle = css`
  :host {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
  }

  span {
      min-width: 60px;
      text-align: center;
  }
`
```

### CSS module scripts
We do not provide support for this functionality yet as ESBuild does not support it yet. You can read how it works [here](https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/)
<!-- ```js
import sheet from './styles.css' assert { type: 'css' };
``` -->

## Components
### Host
Allows to set attributes and event listeners to the host element itself.

### List
Creates a container component without styles with the tag "michi-list"

### Fragment
Creates a container component without styles with the tag "michi-fragment"

### ElementInternals
*(Only available if formAssociated is true)*

It allows to:
- Make the element accessible to the browser
- Access element internals 
- Validate and assign values to forms

### AsyncComponent
Create a component whose content will load after the promise ends. In the meantime you can choose to show a load component or not show anything.

### Link
Provides the ability to move around the web page without reloading the page. It uses the same attributes as an anchor tag but also allows the use of URL objects. Uses the goTo method.

## Custom element methods
### child
Allows to get a child element from the host with the selector

### rerender
Forces the element to re-render

### idGen
Create unique IDs with a discernible key

## Attributes vs Properties in jsx
Usually, if you want to get an html like this:
```html
<div class='test'></div>
```
In React / Stencil / etc you should write a jsx like this:
```jsx
() => <div className='test'></div>
```
And eventually code like this would be executed:
```js
const el = document.createElement('div');
el.className = 'test';
```
In MichiJS you have the freedom to use both attributes and properties and the result will be the same:
```jsx
// Using properties
() => <div _className='test'></div>
// Using attributes
() => <div class='test'></div>
```
And eventually code like this would be executed:
```js
const el = document.createElement('div');
// Using properties
el.className = 'test';
// Using attributes
el.setAttribute('class', 'test')
```
In this way the jsx syntax of MichiJS is more similar to html.

## Special attributes

### $staticChildren
Indicates that their children are created but not updated
### $doNotTouchChildren
Indicates that their Children are not created or updated. Element creation/update is delegated
### $oncreated
Callback that is called when the element is created
### $onupdate
Callback that is called when the element is updated

## Lists
There are 3 ways to create a list
### Using map
It's the usual way to create lists in jsx.
```jsx
const arrayTest = [0, 1, 2];

arrayTest.map(item => <div key={item}>{item}</div>)
```
This will generate an element like:

```html
<michi-list>
  <div>0</div>
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</michi-list>
```
Why create the michi-list element? This is the way to avoid using Virtual DOM. Because the algorithm is dumb, it needs a way to remember that element is a list.

### Using List component
It's similar to using maps. But it allows to use different container than michi-list.
```jsx
const arrayTest = [0, 1, 2];

<List 
  as="span"
  data={arrayTest}
  renderItem={item => <div key={item}>{item}</div>}
/>
```
This will generate an element like:

```html
<span>
  <div>0</div>
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</span>
```
### Using ElementList
Is a proxy that allows you to avoid using dom diff algorithms to render lists. This allows it to have a performance close to vanilla js. An operation on the data implies an operation on the associated elements.
```jsx
const arrayTest = new ElementList(0, 1, 2);

<arrayTest.List 
  as="span"
  renderItem={item => <div>{item}</div>}
/>
```
This will generate an element like:

```html
<span>
  <div>0</div>
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</span>
```

      <td>The entire component</td>
      <td>The entire component</td>
      <td>Just the list itself</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Routing
The intention of using a custom routing tool is to avoid the use of strings to represent the urls and to use modern apis that allow the use of the URL object itself. It also allows to separate the components of the routes which allows a cleaner code.

```js
const Redirect = () => {
  goTo(urls.syncRoute())
  // Will generate and go to this url: /sync-route
  return <></>
}

//Parent routes
export const { urls, Router, pages } = registerRoutes({
  syncRoute: {
    /**The component to display */
    component: <div>Hello World</div>,
    title: 'Sync title'
  },
  //Redirect route
  '/': {
    component: <Redirect />
  },
});

//Child routes
export const { urls: urlsChild, Router: RouterChild, pages: pagesChild } = registerRoutes({
  // Async route
  asyncChildRoute: {
    searchParams: {
      searchParam1: String, 
      searchParam2: Number
    },
    hash: ['#hash1', '#hash2']
    /** The promise to wait */
    promise: async () => (await import('./AsyncChildExample')).AsyncChildExample,
    /**The title of the page */
    title: 'Async Page title'
    /**The component to display while the promise is loading */
    loadingComponent: <span>Loading...</span>
  },
  //The parent route
}, urls.syncRoute);

urlsChild.asyncChildRoute({ searchParams: { searchParam1: 'param 1', searchParam2: 2}, hash: '#hash1' })
// Will generate this url: /sync-route/async-child-route?searchParam1=param+1&searchParam2=2#hash1
```
Router and RouterChild are components that represent the mount points of each registered route.

The "pages" function is a utility to create asynchronous components that includes the search params and component hashes with the types that were defined when the route was registered
```js
export const AsyncChildExample = pagesChild.asyncChildRoute(({ searchParams, hash }) => (
    <>
      {/* Will show the value of searchParam1 */}
      <div>{searchParams.searchParam1}</div>
      {/* Will show true if the hash is #hash1 */}
      <div>{hash['#hash1']}</div>
    </>
  );
);
```

## I18n
It is supported by using a custom store
```js
const translator = new I18n<'es' | 'en'>(localStorage.getItem('lang'));

const store = translator.createTranslation({
  es: () => import('./translations/es.json'),
  en
});
const t = store.state.t;

export const MyComponent = createCustomElement('my-component', {
  subscribeTo: {
    store
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <span>{t.hello}</span>
    );
  }
});
```



## Limitations
### Observable objects
Because some objects are not proxy compatible we limit the observable objects to:
- Arrays
- Dates
- Maps
- Sets
- Any object whose prototype is Object

## Polyfills
If you REALLY need polyfills i recommend you to read this topics:

- https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills
- https://ungap.github.io

## Browser Support
